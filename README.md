Hi CollabLab,


Here is my first React App, not following a tutorial it's a hodge podge mix of what I've taught myself over the last ...few years now.... I feel old! I've worked by myself most of thsi time and need experience working with other devs. 


About this project:

This is my first Web3 Dapp using MetaMask extension to hook into  the MoonBaseAlpha Network for testing out a DevCoin using OpenZepplin ERC20 standard ABI contract. I knew nothing about Crypto or blockchain prior to this....Currently i'm reading up on BTC and Ethereum and making another project using the Polkadot/Kusama chain. Some really cool stuff! Anyways...I'm getting off topic...I hooked up a backend with NodeJS to list users and push back SSE to update the front end once data is submitted to the blockchain, it has some validators, could be cleaner....but I built the static pages in about 4 days, and backend fairly quickly, spent about 3-4 days trying to connect the MetaMask wallet and create the contract.

In a nutshell users can:

Connect their meta mask wallet
Use the DArtsy development test coin to support artists
Can disconnect their wallet
Can vote on proposals

Designs and images were made by a friend.
